# Wordle-Clone
Wordle game in Python terminal.

Before running, make sure you have python installed

Then download the sty library (Should just be pip install sty)

Then your ready to play! Just open up your IDE and run Wordle_Clone.py.

Normal mode means the word can only be chosen from the Wordle word list, while hard mode means the work can be chosen from a list of every five letter word in the english dictionary.

If you want to leave the game, just guess quit.

Good luck (and more updates/bug fixes coming soon)!
